### FUNCTIONS ###
#################
# Basic function
# INPUT - Create a function to add two items


# You call a function like this
# INPUT - Call the function

# Nesting functions
# One functions can be put in another
# and even written inside another
# This function...
# INPUT - Create a function nested inside another
# INPUT - Call the function

# Is the same as this function...
# INPUT - Create a function NOT nested inside another
# INPUT - Call the function

# You can give a function default values if one is not entered
# (these are call keyword arguments or kwargs)
# INPUT - Create a function with a default value
# INPUT - Call the function
# But entering an object will overrule this
# INPUT - Call the function overwritting the defualt value

# Non-kwarg argument must be given in the correct order
# INPUT - Create a function with two args
# INPUT - Call the function
# But kwargs do not need to be given in the correct order
# INPUT - Create a function with two kwargs
# INPUT - Call the function

# You will often see the type of a variable in the method
# this is for guidance so other people use your functions right
# INPUT - Create a function stating the expected type


# it doesn't change how the function works
# INPUT - Call the function

# Do one thing principal
# This function is doing 2 unrelated things
# INPUT - Create a function doing two unrelated things

# This function is doing 3 different but related things
# these should really each be in their own functions
# INPUT - Create a function doing three things

# Like this
# INPUT - Create a function breaking out those three things

# Do things once principal
# This should be in a function
# INPUT - Write out several processes manually

# Like this
# INPUT - Put those processes into a function
