### WHILE LOOPS ###
###################
# Basic use
a = 1
# Start a while loop
# INPUT - Create a while loop until a is 10

# You can leave a loop early with break
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# INPUT - Create a loop which breaks early

# You can skip to the next iteration in a loop with continue
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# INPUT - Create a loop which uses continue
