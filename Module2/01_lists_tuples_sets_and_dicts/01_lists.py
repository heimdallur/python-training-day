# Lists are a colleciton of items made using []
# items are separated by ,
# INPUT - Write a list with 10 items in it

# Select an item in a list using it's index
# Indexes start from 0 being the first item
# and length -1 being the last
# INPUT - Select the first item
# INPUT - Select the last item

# You can select a slice of the list using : separator
# INPUT - Select everything between the 2nd and 4th item (includes the 2nd but not the 4th)
# INPUT - Select everything between the 2nd and last item (includes the 2nd but not the last)
# INPUT - Select everything from the start to the 3rd item (does not include the 3rd item)
# INPUT - Select everything from the 3rd item to the end (includes the 3rd item and goes to the end)

# You can also select every nth item using ::
# INPUT - Select every other item from the start to the end

# Or reverse the order
# INPUT - Select every 1 item in reverse
# INPUT - Select every 2nd item in reverse

# And a combination of these
# INPUT - Select every third item between the 2nd and 9th items

# Lists are "mutable" (this means that items in them can be modified)

# Lists can be combined
# INPUT - Combine two or more lists
# Or added to

# You can get the length of a list with len
# INPUT - Get the length of a list

# Strings can be treated as lists of letters (sometimes)
