# Tuples are a colleciton of items made using ()
# items are separated by ,
# INPUT - Create a tuple with 10 items

# Select an item in a tuple using it's index
# Indexes start from 0 being the first item 
# and length -1 being the last
# INPUT - Select the first item
# INPUT - Select the last item

# You can select a slice of the tuple using : separator
# INPUT - Select everything between the 2nd and 4th item (includes the 2nd but not the 4th)
# INPUT - Select everything between the 2nd and last item (includes the 2nd but not the last)
# INPUT - Select everything from the start to the 3rd item (does not include the 3rd item)
# INPUT - Select everything from the 3rd item to the end (includes the 3rd item and goes to the end)

# You can also select every nth item using ::
# INPUT - Select every other item from the start to the end

# Or reverse the order
# INPUT - Select every 1 item in reverse
# INPUT - Select every 2nd item in reverse

# And combine these
# INPUT - Select every third item between the 2nd and 9th items

# Tuples can be combined
# INPUT - Combine two or more tuples
# Or added to 
# INPUT - Add to a tuple

# BUT tuples are "immutable" (this means that items in them CANNOT be modified)
# INPUT - Change the 3rd item to foo (this will error)

# You can convert tuples to tuples though
# INPUT - Convert a tuple to a list and modify it

# You can get the length of a tuple with len
# INPUT - Get the length of a tuple
